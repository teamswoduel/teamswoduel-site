Where we went from friends to sisters I've watched you blossom and grow stand and pray and things change I watched you let go of Ejay knowing if it was Gods plan you will get him back. I met Ejay when him and Swodei began 'linking' as you call it and knew he was great and out of all our friends there relationship was so solid I saw him love Swodei through all her different stages and that amazed me! When I saw him also have such a deep relationship in Christ and be apart of our ministry I knew he was a keeper and when I saw them both love God more than eachother I knew God had given them his seal of approval. Il call Ejay a fighter I've seen him go through fire and come out unburnt I've seen him put his faith to the test! But best of all love my friend with all his heart which in turn turned him from Swodeis boyfriend to my friend and brother. I want to Thankyou both for inspiring me and showing me that when working together anything is possible for all the advice how could I ever forget that there both chefs and probably will have cookery books out soon! Remember I spoke that into being lol. Thanks for showing me wedding planning is possible! I want you both to know just as now I'm here for you both and love you so much! I pray God continues to honour and bless your union and your marriage will not be like any road in Lambeth with pot holes and bumps but smooth like one in a pretty green country side! Continue to pray and love each other  enjoy each others  growth agree to disagree compromise and keep smiling  to the soon to be Jones! This is only the beginning!
