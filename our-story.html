                        <p><span class="lead special-red">Emmanuel:</span> It was a cold autumn night in central London, Leicester Square to be precise. I was outside the club with the lads waiting to gain entry for the student night.</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">Swodei:</span> It was the late evening on the 22nd October, my Birthday. After having a Birthday dinner with my friends we decided to go to the Club previously Known as CC's in Leicester Square, with no other spot open that we liked and that was local we figured, that will be a the plan for the night.</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">E:</span> It was a really slow night not much to be excited about, but a young Nubian lady caught my eye wearing tie-dye cloth. So as you do I kept it calm, collected placed a polo mint in my mouth then I went in for the approach. I tried to keep it as cool as a cucumber, nudged my wing man Alfred to come with me, he was about to see me in action.</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">S:</span> After coming into the half empty club with my girls we decided to make a night of it. We danced, and danced and danced the night away. After a while a group of guys came in, paying no mind I carried on dancing. After a while the party shifted to one side of the venue and I used that as an opportunity to try and get reception coverage to use my phone, and then he approached me…</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">E:</span> Then I used the worst chat up line ever, “excuse me, what country are you from?” she attempted to give me attitude but I bypassed that and pretended I did not see her. She responded “Sierra-Leone and Nigeria, why?” (all this time no eye contact from her). To which I replied “Oh my country!” Then her facial expression dropped, I followed on saying, “yeah, Sierra Leone!” that grabbed her attention and I saw a twinkle in her eye. </p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">S:</span> He asked “What country are you from?”, reluctantly I replied “Sierra Leone and Nigeria. Why?” Constantly looking at my phone screen he responded “Oh your from my country!” Rolling my eyes with my own assumptions he then said “Yh Sierra Leone”, I curiously looked up to see this tall, dark and handsome flyboy, I then said “Oh!”</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">E:</span> We then started to get a dialogue going, we made general chit chat, then in order to make sure I did not come across as too keen I told her to make sure she finds me at the end of the night.</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">S:</span> We began to talk briefly as we were in the club ending off saying to me “Come find me after the rave”. With a frown then fake smile, I falsely nodded as he walked off. (momma didn’t raise no fool a King looks for his Queen). I walked back to join my friends and thought nothing of it.</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">E:</span> I went back to accompany the lads, we continued to party the night away until the night was over.</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">S:</span> At the end of the night We rounded up the girls said our goodbyes and split up to our various locations. Young and carefree my batch aimed for the bus stop LOL. That’s when I saw him in the middle of a conversation with a mate. I carried on my way to that bus stop, it was too cold and my feet were burning.</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">E:</span> After it was all said and done the night turned out to be a pretty decent one. The lads and I were congregating outside the venue talking, whilst some were trying to get the attention of some ladies. One of my friends saw a girl he noticed in the rave that he wanted to talk to, so he made his way towards her as I continued to walk at a steady pace.</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">S:</span> As we walked to the bus stop, a friend of mind stopped to chat with a friend of Emmanuels, Eager to get my shoes off I called out her name so we can go. That’s when it happened!!!!!!</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">E:</span> As I was walking I noticed the girl in the African cloth, who had caught my eye was in the direction my friend was heading towards. I realised it was now or never, it was time to go in for the kill, so I began to proceed in power walking towards her (she always says I ran).</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">S:</span> He ran (he says he jogged LOL) across the road to were I was and cheekily said “I fort I told you to come talk to man after the rave” I cheekily respond “I have a home to go to” going back and fourth in cheeky convo, he then asked “so what, can man get your number?”  I replied “why are you referring to yourself in third person?” with dismissal of my question he asked his previous question again, I responded “I’ll take yours sorry I don’t give out my number” (he was cheeky so I wasn’t giving in that easy).</p>
                        <p><span class="lead special-red">E:</span> I approached her, confident that my charm was enough to secure her number. We went back in forth in conversation, thinking this girl is cheeky but she is a hottie so I will let her off (if she made a cheeky remark I would make right back), I persisted and asked for her number, She made a comment about not using and abusing her number, I laughed. One of her friends was being really annoying attempting to sabotage all the progress I had made, telling her they had to go, I had to ignore the friend and proceed to assure the now future Mrs Jones, that I would not abuse her number.</p>
<p><span class="lead special-red">S:</span> I remember trying to use all of my cheekiest lyrics, as I said I don’t want people to abuse rather than use my number, so I’ll take yours, sternly he said ” naaaaahhh coz you wont call man” I laughed coz he was onto me Lol. My friends yelled out my name as our bus was shortly arriving, so I turnt to him and said ive got to go, he responded,  “I would never abuse ur number” and smiled. That’s when I saw the dimples …GLORY….IT CAME SPILLING OUT 079…….  We exchanged numbers and left it as that, the rest was/is History in the making <span class="bold">smiley face</span>.</p>                                      <p> <span class="lead special-red">E:</span> The end result was I got her number, made her my Girlfriend, then my Fiancé, now she’s going t be my wife!</p>
                   <p class="italic threesize">To be continued...</p>
                   <h3 class="special-red">Moral of the story:</h3><p><span class="lead special-red">Swodei:</span>
Always be a lady, but never act too stuck up because you don’t know who will become your husband lol!</p>
<p><span class="lead special-red">Emmanuel:</span>
If you don’t ask you will never receive. (I asked, persisted and got her number.</p>
